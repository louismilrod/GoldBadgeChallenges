# Komodo Industries

I've built 3 repositories for Komodo.
1. Is for their food service industry to keep track of Menu and Menu Items
2. Is for their insurance division to help them process claims faster.
3. Is to gather data about green cars for their car lot.

### Executing program

1. Run Program.cs and cycle trough the prompts to add and create combo items.
2. Run program.cs to being your journey through the fast pace life of a claims adjuster. Again just follow the prompts.
3. Has many different car types to gather data about them. Follow the prompts to add, read and delete!
